## Research and sources
- Heading sources: autocomplete for 'voice memo transcription' (can iPhone transcribe / not working / is it good / are voice memos illegal) plus brief questions. Apple facts from Apple Support 'View a Voice Memos transcription on iPhone'.
- Competitor and vendor facts are cited in plain text only (no links), checked 2026-09-30.
- Keyword volumes: Ubersuggest US (locId 2840), pulled 2026-09-30. The daily report limit was reached before new keyword lookups, so `keywords_added` uses brief keywords already measured that day.

## Open items for content writers (not shown in the article)

**1. Author and images**
- Add a named author and a short bio (E-E-A-T requirement), then set `author` and `author_bio_url` in the frontmatter.
- Add the featured image at the path in `featured_image_path` (1200x630) with the alt text in `featured_image_alt`, and add screenshots from our own accounts.
